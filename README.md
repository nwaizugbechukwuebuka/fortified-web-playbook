- **Audit Logging** - Security event tracking and monitoring

### ðŸŽ¯ OWASP Top 10 Mitigations Demonstrated

1. **Injection Prevention** - Parameterized queries ready (backend integration required)
2. **Broken Authentication** - Secure session management patterns
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Data encryption and secure storage patterns
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - Secure parsing implementations
5. **Broken Access Control** - Role-based authorization demos
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - Secure defaults and configuration
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Input sanitization and output encoding
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - Safe data handling practices
9. **Known Vulnerabilities** - Dependency management and monitoring
10. **Insufficient Logging** - Comprehensive audit trail implementation

## Technology Stack

## Security Features Implemented

### Frontend Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Prevention**: React's JSX provides built-in XSS protection
- **Secure Headers**: Ready for CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
- **Form Protection**: CSRF token ready implementation
- **Authentication UI**: Secure login/logout interface patterns
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling ready for backend
- **Role-Based UI**: Components that adapt based on user permissions

### Security Monitoring
- **Audit Dashboard**: Visual security status monitoring
- **Security Scoring**: Real-time security posture assessment
- **Vulnerability Indicators**: Clear security status communication
- **Activity Logging**: Security event tracking interface

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-web-application
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Access the application**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
- Explore the security dashboard and features

## Backend Integration Required

This frontend application is designed to integrate with a secure backend for full OWASP compliance:

### Required Backend Features
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL with parameterized queries
- **Authentication**: JWT or session-based secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security audit logging
- **HTTPS**: TLS/SSL encryption
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and throttling
- **CSRF Protection**: Server-side CSRF token validation

### Recommended Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express or similar secure framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints
- **Security Middleware**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting
- **Authentication**: Passport.js or similar secure auth library
- **Validation**: Server-side input validation and sanitization
- **Monitoring**: Winston logging with security event tracking

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] XSS attempt prevention
- [ ] CSRF token validation (when backend integrated)
- [ ] Authentication flow security
- [ ] Authorization boundary testing
